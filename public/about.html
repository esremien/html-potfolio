<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a mix of quiet and outgoing. I like my alone time, thinking deeply about things. That makes me an ambivert â€“
   I'm shy and anxious sometimes, but other times, I'm cool hanging out with people.</p>

<p>When I'm by myself, I'm in my zone, thinking about stuff deeply. I see things in my own way. But, being shy and 
  anxious makes it tough to join in social things sometimes. But hey, when I do join, people see the caring side of me.</p>

<p>I'm good at finding a balance between chilling alone and hanging out. Even though being shy and anxious can be hard, 
  they're part of what makes me unique. They shape how I see the world in a way that fits both quietness and liveliness.</p>
